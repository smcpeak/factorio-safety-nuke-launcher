[mod-setting-description]
safety-nuke-launcher-min-range=The launcher will refuse to fire at locations closer than this many tiles.  For comparison, the max range when firing non-nukes is 36, for nukes it is 54 or 108 (see next option), and the nuclear explosion radius is 35 (in an unmodded game).
safety-nuke-launcher-range-bonus=Independent of what launcher is used, this sets the range bonus of nuclear rockets to 300% (its pre-1.0 value) instead of 150%, making its effective range 108 tiles.
