Introduction
============
Safety Nuke Launcher is a mod for [Factorio](https://wiki.factorio.com/).  It adds
a rocket launcher that has a configurable minimum range in order to reduce
the occurrences of the player accidentally nuking themselves due to thinking
they had a different weapon equipped.

I made this mod after doing it to myself one too many times...

Installation
============
Copy the release zip file (SafetyNukeLauncher_X.Y.Z.zip) into the "mods" subfolder
of the [User Data Directory](https://wiki.factorio.com/Application_directory#User_Data_directory).
Then start (or restart) Factorio.  It should then appear in the Mods
list available from the Factorio main menu, initially enabled.

Usage
=====
Unlock the new technology (atomic bombs are a prerequisite) and craft the
new Safety nuke launcher item.  Replace your existing rocket launcher with
the new one.  Then worry no more about nuking your feet!

The minimum range is configurable.  By default it is 30.  For comparison,
the nuclear explosion radius is 35.  So with the default setting it is
still possible to nuke yourself if you don't move at all after firing, but
also possible to strike relatively close targets.

If you regularly use non-nuclear rockets, you may want to lower the
minimum range.  With non-nuclear rockets, the maximum range is 36, so the
default minimum range of 30 only provides a narrow window of usability.
(There does not appear to be an easy way to make the minimum range depend
on the type of ammo equipped.)
